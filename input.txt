# The input file must consist of 4 parts: "Sample", "Detector", "Illumination", and "Solid angle".
# The sequence of the four parts is not important.
# Some of the first-level parts consist of second-level parts.
# The start of a part is indicated by part-name followed by a ":" in a single line.
# The ending of a part is indicated by empty lines (can contain whitespaces, tabs, etc.).
# The end of the lowest level part needs one empty line; the end of the second lowest level part needs two, and so on.
# Contents after the first '#' will be ignored.
# Leading and ending whitespaces, tabs, etc. in one line will be ignored.
# Conflicting statements will be overwritten by the last valid one.
